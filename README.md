A Linked List Tutorial written by a student

In this tutorial I will be teaching you about the data structure Linked List. A linked list is a sequence container where the sequence can be changed very easily. It is useful when you want an easy way to add elements anywhere in your list or the list needs to change frequently. It also doesn't require the memory to be in the same place so the memory can be allocated to any available spot with enough room for the element. Elements in linked lists are referred to as nodes, because unlike arrays or vectors, each node holds more that just the value of the variable. It holds the value of the variable and the pointer to the next node. Depending on the type of linked list it can also hold a pointer to the previous node. Using pointers also allows nodes to be added to the beginning of the list as well as in the middle and the end very easily without causing problems.

Linked Lists can be used in two ways in C++, with 'forward_list' as a singly linked list or with 'list' as a doubly linked list. The difference between these two is that a singly linked list can only go from the beginning of the list and follow the nodes to the end of the list and a doubly linked list can start from the beginning and go to the end or start from the end and go to the beginning. In a singly linked list each node holds one pointer to the next node, but in a doubly linked list each node holds two pointers, one ot the next node and one to the previous node. If a node is at the end of the list then it points to null.

In order to make a linked list the type of list needs to be specified followed by the type of values the list will be holding the the name of the list suche as forward_list<int> singlyList;. In both forward_list and list there are the functions push_front() and pop_front(). push_front() puts whatever value stated in the function to the front of the list. pop_front() deletes the first value from the front of the list. list also has push_back() and pop_back() which are similar to the previous functions but they push and pop values from the end of the list.
