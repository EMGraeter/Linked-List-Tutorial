# Linked-List-Tutorial
A Linked List Tutorial written by a student

In this tutorial I will be teaching you about the data structure Linked List. A linked list is a sequence container where the sequence can be changed very easily. It is useful when you want an easy way to add elements anywhere in your list or the list needs to change frequently. It also doesn't require the memory to be in the same place so the memory can be allocated to any available spot with enough room for the element. Elements in linked lists are referred to as nodes, because unlike arrays or vectors, each node holds more that just the value of the variable. It holds the value of the variable and the pointer to the next node. Depending on the type of linked list it can also hold a pointer to the previous node.
Using pointers also allows nodes to be added to the beginning of the list as well as in the middle and the end very easily without causing problems.
